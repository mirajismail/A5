hello\_mpi.c, send\_recv\_mpi.c, pi\_mpi.c, parallel\_search\_mpi.c, game\_of\_life\_mpi.c
To compile, simply run make, and the executables will have the names of their respective c files.

Solutions to lab 2 are in Q4/mpi-lab-exercises/lab2 in
pi\_collectives.c, pi\_nonblocking.c, send\_recv\_plus1.c, parallel\_search-collectives.c, game\_of\_life-collectives.c
To compile, simply run make, and the executables will have the names of their resective c files.

Solutions to lab 3 are in Q4/mpi-lab-exercises/lab3 in
hello\_mpi.c, mpi\_derived\_types.c
To compile, simply run make, and the executables will have the same names of their respective c files.
